### Get Telegram Bot Tokens

- You go to @BotFather in Telegram and use the /newbot command.
- You enter the name of the bot. only paying attention to the format, for example: **TelegramBot **or **Telegram_Bot** must end with Bot.
- You can now trade with the token it gives you.


### How can I make it work
1. Clone the project with Git clone.
2. Do **npm install** for package installations in the folder you cloned.
3. Add your required** port number** and bot token to your **.env** file .
4. You are ready to run with **npm run dev **

### Used Libraries
1. [node-telegram-bot-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-telegram-bot-api) to manage the telegram bot .
2. [bing-translate-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bing-translate-api) to translate simply.
3.Â [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to access environment variables.

###Recommendation
I used ready-made packages because I wanted to show it in a simple way. 
You can make it from the main documentation and develop it further.
